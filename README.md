We build AI powered Vedic Wisdom Hub that contains specialised chatbot as tutors for specific vedas. We build an interactive platform with good user interface where the user can select a particular Veda and then start their learning journey from scratch. The main motive of this Vedic wisdom Hub is to make learning veda simple and interactive for everyone. With this platform, you don't need to go through the Vedic Text just to get any sort of information about the vedas, just one click and enthusiasm is enough to get started. <br> <br>

**Future Improvements:** <br>
- We will try to integrate other sanskrit data such as other literature texts, grammar texts, mythology texts, etc
- We will try to make understand and communicate real time in sanskrit with the user so that the user can learn sanskrit by practically speaking and learning by recommended corrections system.
- We tried to integrate audio to the tutors so that they can recite the texts many times to make users more comfortable with the language.The Audio Bot contains the file to initate a bot where we can input any sanskrit text in sa script and it will give its proper text to speech version in audio file. But even after trying several times, we were unable to integrate the audio due to time shortage.
